  + The main reason is because there is critical path in code that cannot run concurrently
    ```C++
        void calculation(long long round) {
            int lastRound = round - 1;
            for0(i, N) {
                double weight = 0;
                long long* nodesId = new long long[edgesTo[i].size()];
                for0(j, edgesTo[i].size()) {
                    nodesId[j] = edgesTo[i][j];
                }
                // CRITICAL START.
                // Talking with redis, cache here.


                double* values = getNodesVal(nodesId, edgesTo[i].size(), lastRound);


                // CRITICAL END
                free(nodesId);
                for0(j, edgesTo[i].size()) {
                    const int fromNode = edgesTo[i][j];
                    weight += values[j] / toNodesCount[fromNode];
                }
                free(values);
                setNodeVal(i, weight, round);
            }
        }
    ```
  + Theoritically, this should not be a critical path, and should be able to paralize. But current code return core dump all the times. (Not yet able to debug)
    + => Comeback with OpenMP later when have time. 

## Reading paper about `Proxy-Guided Load Balancing of Graph Processing Workloads on Heterogeneous Clusters` 

+ Paper [Proxy-Guided Load Balancing of Graph Processing Workloads on Heterogeneous Clusters](../paper/ICPP2016_LoadBalancing%20(1).pdf)
+ Paper summary:
  + 1.5 times faster on Heterogeneous Clusters with 25% less energy
  + Heterogeneous degree calculation:
    + ![error](./images/ccr.png)
  + There is 3 main algo for graph cutting using vertex cuts (Cannot find edges cuts in this paper) with thier modification for Heterogeneous Clusters
    + `Random`: Hash -> assign to worker by generated hash (purely random)
      + ![error](./images/heterogeneity_aware_random.png)
    + `Oblivious`: The Oblivious parti-tioning algorithm is designed to enhance data locality bypartitioning based on the history of edge assignments.
    + `Grid`: The Grid method is designed to limit the communication overheads by constraining the number of candidate machines for each assignmen

## Next work

+ Clean source code as it is too messy to maintain now
+ Find more paper to read about graph processing to gain insight.
