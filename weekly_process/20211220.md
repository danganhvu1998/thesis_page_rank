## Result

###  About Data Set
+ 4.8M nodes graph is a real data set, with some nodes have a lot of edges, and some nodes have no edges at all.
+ Other data set is generated one, with each node have exactly the same amount of edges.

### Conclusion

+ Our application is clearly out run graphX
+ NOTE: GraphX do not have dynamic load balancing: much slower in real life graph.
+ GraphX suffer from increasing S(E) / S(N) (Probably this mean more communication is needed)
