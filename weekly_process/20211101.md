1. Reason why CPU usage is too high in `Raspberry Pi 4`

    + Following function was used to create command to get information from redis.

        ```c++
        void strCat(char* destString, char* srcString) {
            int currPos = strlen(destString);
            int srcLen = strlen(srcString);
            for (int i = 0; i < srcLen; i++) {
                destString[currPos] = srcString[i];
                ++currPos;
            }
            destString[currPos] = '\0';
        }
        ```

    + The command is like: `GET ` + `node_{id}_{round}` * 50000, so strCat was called 50000 times
        + 0.5 - 1 second for laptop / desktop
        + 5-7 seconds for Raspberry Pi 4
    + This function is not O(N). Proof: [strCat Test](./test/strcat.cpp)

1. Fix
    + Modify code to get rid of strCat function.
        + Longer, harder to read, but it is O(N)
    + Change how data is stored in Redis (Example for a graph with 4M nodes)
        + Before: 4M records stored in Redis each round
            + `node_1_1: "0.123"`, `node_2_1: "1.23"`, (4M records like that)
            + => Slower get, and longger command to get, set
        + After: 4M records stored in pack. Each pack contain data of maximum 2M5 nodes (Tested with 250, 2500, 250000, 2M5. 250000 and 2M5 deliver the best result)
            + `pack_1_1: "0.125,1.23,..."` -> 8 packs
            + => Faster get, and shorter command to get, set

1. Result (Times / Round)
    + 4.8M Nodes, 68M Edges
        + 1 workers
            + Laptop / Desktop: 121s - 5.2s
            + Raspberry Pi 4: 1038s - Experiment result lost
        + 2 workers
            + Laptop / Desktop: 62s - 5s (15-30% times is sleeping due to cannot yet get the needed pack)
            + Raspberry Pi 4: 902s - Experiment result lost
        + 4 workers
            + Raspberry Pi 4: 1034s - 7.2s
        + 7 workers
            + Raspberry Pi 4: 943 - 5s
    + 10M Nodes, 300M Edges
        + Laptop / Desktop:
            + 1 Worker: 20s
            + 2 Workers: 14s
