### Conclusion
+ Can improve cache by using a different algorithm that support bulk search.
+ Using pre-assigned memory instead of using `malloc`

# Paper

+ Some ideas:
  + Work stealing
    + ![error](./images/work_stealing.png)
  + Communication-Aware Load Balancing
    + Each worker have to communicate the same amount of time with other workers (Inner communication cost consider as 0)
  + Distributed Edge Migration
    + Sharing workload by sending edges instead of nodes
+ It seems like approaches using purely algorithm bring very limited result. Most of papers start to consider using hardware specified for graph processing. And then from specialized computer, using a specialized algorithm that only effect on that structure.
  + Bringing ram closer to cpu
  + Using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) ???
  + Modifying ram structure

# Next step

+ reduce communication with other worker redis using better caching
